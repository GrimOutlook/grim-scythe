# The Scythe

A small utilities crate for those with a Grim Outlook

I usually will have taken a look through `crates.io` to see if there were any
well maintained projects with the same functionality but not found anything.
There are almost certainly crates with the same functionality as many of the
functions/macros/traits in here, but they'll either have minimal maintenance or
I won't have been able to find them. `crates.io` isn't the easiest to search
through :/
